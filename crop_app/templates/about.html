        <h1>About Our Platform</h1>

        <div class="section">
            <p>Welcome to the  <span>🌱SmartCropCare🌾</span><i> AI-powered <strong>Crop Disease Detection and Prevention System</strong></i>, a smart solution to assist farmers, gardeners, and researchers in identifying plant diseases early and accurately.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>Our platform uses deep learning models trained on the <strong>New Plant Disease Dataset</strong> from Kaggle to analyze plant leaf images and detect diseases with high accuracy. Once detected, it provides easy-to-follow prevention steps to control and manage the disease.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You upload a clear image of the affected plant leaf.</li>
                <li>Our AI model processes the image and predicts the disease based on visual patterns.</li>
                <li>We show you the name of the disease, detailed description, and step-by-step prevention tips.</li>
                <li>We also display reference images to help you visually verify the diagnosis.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
